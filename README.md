Note: command names that contain `(s)` indicate that they can also be executed using their plural form. 
e.g., `s!weapon` yields the same result as `s!weapons`

# Purpose
HuntStat is aimed to automate theHunter communities that use Discord as their platform by:
1. generating random hunt conditions:
    1. `s!map(s)`
    2. `s!weapon(s)`
    3. `s!theme(s)`
    4. `s!modifier(s)`
2. retrieving community members' URL
    1. `s!widget`
    2. `s!profile`
    3. `s!uhc`
3. generating a leaderboard for your community
    1. `s!leaderboard`

# Usage
You must register your community members for commands such as `s!widget`. You can do so by executing `s!register`.
When someone leaves your community, you can unregister them: `s!unregister`.

For all commands: `s!info` or `s!help`.
For more information on a particular command: `s!info <command_name>`

# Note
The bot is currently a WIP and will change drastically still. Core functionality, however, will probably remain the same.
