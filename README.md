Note: command names that contain `(s)` indicate that they can be executed by their plural form, 
e.g., `s!weapon` yields the same result as `s!weapons`

# Purpose
HuntStat is a bot aimed to automate theHunter communities by:
1. generating a random map to play on:
    1. `s!map(s)`
    2. `s!reserve(s)`
2. generating a random weapon loadout to play with:
    1. `s!gun(s)`
    2. `s!weapon(s)`
3. generating a random clothing theme:
    1. `s!theme`
4. generating a random game modifier:
    1. `s!modifier(s)`

A limitation to the bot is that it requires you to register your members:  
- `s!register <discord_tag#0000> <theHunter_name>`
- `s!register <@discord_name> <theHunter_name>`

Once registered, the bot can generate some useful statistics about your community:
1. a hunter's widget: 
    1. `s!widget <@discord_name | tag#0000 | theHunter_name>`
2. a leaderboard of all your members: 
    1. `s!leaderboard(s)`
